#TODO List#

###Suggestions by [heitorlessa](https://github.com/heitorlessa)###

* A Region is actually defined under Mappings not Parameters so the user has the ability to deploy in multiple regions
* removing "Default" from S3 Bucket Resource and force the user to input a name OR via shell create a hash within the s3 bucket name
* Disclaimer there that this is an exercise, not tested in Prod (perhaps a fancy shield.io too)
* Too much Sleep in the Shell Script.
* Specify IAM policies for running the script. Maybe a File can be included OR include in the README.MD itself
